# Assignment Three - Q1: Row & Column Weight Split Layout

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Jetpack Compose**’s `weight` modifier to build proportional layouts in Android.  

The screen is divided into two sections:
- A **Row** that splits the screen horizontally into:
  - **25% width (red)** → A simple column with text.  
  - **75% width** → A more complex section.  
- Inside the larger section, a **Column** is divided vertically into three weighted parts with a **2:3:5 ratio**, each with a distinct background color and text label.  

This layout helps visualize how space can be allocated flexibly across UI components without using fixed dimensions.
